## what does this project do?
I donno, ask someone else.

## how can somebody run this project?:
As a typical django project. And if you're too lazy as a typical developer, just copy-paste the following commands:

0. the only requirement is `python3`

1. create a venv (optional)
```
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

2. install requirements
```
pip3 install django
pip3 install django-crispy-forms
```

3. django things, as always
```
python3 manage.py migrate
python3 manage.py createsuperuser
python3 manage.py runserver
```
